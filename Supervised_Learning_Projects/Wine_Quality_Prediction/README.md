<h1> 🍇 Wine Quality Prediction </h1>
A machine learning project focused on predicting wine quality using a random forest classifier, feature engineering, and data analysis from a Kaggle dataset.
<hr>
<h2> 📌 Project Overview </h2> 
This project builds a complete machine learning workflow to predict wine quality. After loading a Kaggle dataset, I performed basic analysis, visualizations, and statistical checks. Then, I trained a random forest classifier and evaluated its performance, achieving 92% accuracy.

<h2> 🔄 Workflow Summary </h2> 
<h3> 1. Data Collection: </h3>
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. After loading it, I performed basic analysis by checking the shape, missing values, and summary statistics.
<h3> 2. Data Visualization: </h3>
I visualized the data by plotting the number of wines for each quality using a catplot. Then, I plotted volatile acidity versus quality (inverse relation) and citric acid versus quality (direct relation). I also checked correlations between numeric features and plotted a heatmap to observe positive and negative relationships.
<h3> 3. Data Processing: </h3>
I separated the data into features (X) and target (Y). Then, I split the data into training and testing sets using train-test split.
<h3> 4. Model Selection and Training: </h3>
I chose a random forest classifier from scikit-learn. After fitting the model on the training set, I evaluated it using the accuracy score from metrics.
<h3> 5. Model Evaluation: </h3>
The model achieved an accuracy of 92%, which indicates strong performance in predicting wine quality.
